#DevOps Laterals Task

basically, i have implemented the LEVEL-1 of the project still a lot of optimization can be done but i have not done it and kept it for the last.
I have taken care of dockerization and implementation of Nginx reverse proxy.

##TECH STACK :
 ###Backend:
    a) Rust
    b) Actix-web
    c) Diesel ORM
    d) PostgreSQL
 ###Frontend: 
    a) React
 ###DEVOPS
    a) Docker
    b) Docker Compose
    c) Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
    d) Git & GitHub


##HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT : 
    ###PRE-REQUISITES : 
        1) DOCKER
        2) DOCKER COMPOSE 
        3) GIT
    
    ###STEPS : 
        1) CLONE THE REPOSITORY 
        2) RUN IN BASH "docker compose up -d"
        3) open the browser and go to http://localhost

##LIST OF ALL THE PROBLEMS FACED WITH SOLUTIONS : 
    ###1) RUST COMPILE FAILURE INSIDE DOCKER 
            INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRESENT RUST VERSION WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COMPILE PROPERLY (`time` crate – E0282)
            WE SOLVED IT BY UPDATING THE 'TIME' CRATE TO '>=0.3.3.5'
    ###2) CARGO FETCH AND BUILD FAILURE 
            THEY FAILED DURING BUILD BECAUSE THEY WERE RUN BEFORE '/SRC' EXISTED IN THE IMAGE SO JJUST REORDERED THE DOCKERFILE STEPS
    ###3) DIESEL COMMAND NOT FOUND 
            DIESEL MIGRATION RUN FAILED ON WINDOWS AND INSIDE CONTAINER BECAUSE DIESEL CLI WAS NOT INSTALLED AND BACKEND RUNTIME DID NOT INCLUDE DIESEL SO WE MODIFIED THE DOCKER FILE ACCORDINGLY 
    ###4) DIESLE MIGRATIONS DIRECTORY NOT FOUND 
            UNABLE TO FIND MIGRATIONS DIRECTORY BECAUSE CONTAINERS ARE ISOLATED AND MIGRATIONS/ EXISTED IN THE PROJECT ROOT AND NOT INSIDE CONTAINERS SO WHAT WE DID WAS MOUNTED /BACKEND FILES INTO THE CONTAINER 
    ###5) RELATIONS USERS DOES NOT EXIST 
            LOGIN.REGISTER FAILED DUE TO MISSING TABLES
            MIGRATIONS WERE NOT RUNNING SO, FIXED THAT 
    ###6) DATABASE CONNECTION ERRORS
            WAS USING LOCALHOST INSIDE THE DB CONTAINER WHICH IS NOT CORRECT 
    ###7) A VERY SILLY MISTAKE FOR A LOT OF TIME I WAS CONFUSED BETWEEN FOLDER, SERVICE AND CONTAINER NAMES
    ###8) PORT CONFUSION 
            IN FIRST I WAS MAKING EVERYTHING LISTEN DIRECTLY ON PORTS 3000, 8080 AND 80 BUT LATER MADE ONLY PORT 80 (NGINX) EXPOSED INFRONT AND OTHERS ARE INTERNAL.
            IN A WAY THAT NGINX ONLY DIRECTS THE REQUESTS TO FRONTEND AND BACKEND
    ###9) SPA ROUTING 
            THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHERE / WORKED BUT /LOGIN AND /REGISTER WERE FAILING 
            REACT IS A SPA AND NGINX WAS TRYING TO FIND FILES THAT DOE
            SO ADDED SPA FALLBACK IN FRONTEND NGINX.
    ###10) AFTER SPA ROUTING NO EFFECT WAS SEEN
            BECAUSE I WAS USING THE PRE-BUILD IMAGES SO I NEEDED TO OVERWRITE THE IMAGES AND PULL AGAIN 
    ###11) REGISTER BUTTON WAS NOT WORKING
            API ROUTING WAS NOT MATCHING THE REVERSE PROXY RULES SO HAD TO FIX THE ROUTING I FOUND THIS USING INSPECT AND WENT TO NETWORK. REQUEST AND RESPONSES HELPED ME SOLVE THIS 
    ###12) LOGIN/REGISTER RETURNED 405
            405 WAS SEEN IN POST REQUESTS 
            BASICALLY THE BACKEND REQUESTS WERE ROUTED TO THE FRONTEND REQUESTS 
            SO I ROUTED THAT REQUESTS TO /API/*
    ###13) SOME BASIC GIT PROBLEMS WAS FACED BUT SOLVED IT AS EASE
    ###14) IN THE START I WAS LOCALLY USING BUILD IN COMPOSE.YML FILES BUT LATED UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF ci/cd and STARTED TO CHANGE TO IMAEGE THAT WOULD HELP US IN A WAY BETTER MANNER.
